# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

### Overview
Develop Deep Learning Models for Natural Language in Python

### Description
Python is the go-to language for applied machine learning and deep learning, both in terms
of demand from employers and employees. This is not least because it could be a renaissance
for machine learning tools. I have focused on showing you how to use the best of breed Python
tools for natural language processing such as Gensim and NLTK, and even a little scikit-learn.
Key to getting results is speed of development, and for this reason, we use the Keras deep
learning library as you can define, train, and use complex deep learning models with just a few
lines of Python code.

There are three key areas that you must know when working with text:
1. How to clean text. This includes loading, analyzing, filtering and cleaning tasks required
prior to modeling.
2. How to represent text. This includes the classical bag-of-words model and the modern
and powerful distributed representation in word embeddings.
3. How to generate text. This includes the range of most interesting problems, such as image
captioning and translation.
